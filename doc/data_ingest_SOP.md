### Data Ingest SOP

1. When we become aware of a new dataset:
    * Make dataset record in KB
    * Assign 1 person to oversee primary metadata curation (minimum needed for image publication).  
    Appropriate person depends on image type (expression pattern vs anatomy)
    
2. Contact data submitters with

  a. draft proposal for dataset metadata:

  Dataset short name
  Title
  Description
  Associated publication
  (License - present standard CC)
  
  b. Any relevant querstions about filenames or additional data they might provide.

3. Make sure general tickets are in place to track associated curation:
  * Anatomy
  * Expression 
  * Phenotype
